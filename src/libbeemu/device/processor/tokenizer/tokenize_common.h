	 * @brief Given an instruction, determine its byte length and canonize its rep.
	 *
	 * Instructions in gameboy architecture has variable sizes, between 1 and 3 bytes,
	 * therefore we need to cleanup up the clutter (ie: the actual instruction is left padded
	 * with some "noise" that must be deleted on its right.)
	 *
	 * @param instruction Partially constructed instruction whose operands are partially broken
	 * eg: since we always fetch 3 bytes into a uint32_t integer, if our instruction is only two bytes
	 * long, both the least and most significant bytes are actually redundant/noise and must be discarded,
	 * then the instruction must be right padded, or shifted 8 bits to the right.
	 * @return least-significant byte of the instruction, for CBXX this is, of course CB
	 * but for other instructions this is the OPCODE itself.
